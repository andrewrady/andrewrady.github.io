      <description>Golang First API I have been following Golang for a little but. It seemed interesting to me for a few reasons. One major one was the speed of it. Another was it&amp;rsquo;s syntax is similar to python. I am no python developer, but I have made a few side project with it. SO I decided to update and an aging Rails application. It&amp;rsquo;s just a simple crud application that displays martial arts rings at tournaments.</description>

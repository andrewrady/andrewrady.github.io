      <description>Connecting your Rails application to a database Rails default setup uses sqlite which is a great way to get starting building applications, but at some point we will need to connect to a real database. Whether you need functionality that is specific to a certain database, or you want to simulate your production environment more. Connecting to a database is pretty easy with Rails. The first thing you will need is a database installed on your computer.</description>

      <description>Rails development on Windows Developing Rails applications on windows has always been a pain. It&amp;rsquo;s simple enough to install ruby and the need gems to get a basic Rails application started, but in time developers will run into problems. A lot of gem work fine in a windows environment, but some do not compile down correctly and this is the main issue with developing on Windows. For this reason many people who need to work on Rails applications are running their development environment on OSX or Linux, including me.</description>

      <description>Hello, World! My name is Andrew Rady and I am currently a front end developer at Ritter Insurance Marketing working with Vue. I have been writing some blog post on our company blog at rimdev.io, but I wanted to start a personal one. On rimdev.io most of my articles are around vue since that is what I work on mostly, but I want to be able to share some of my experiences from side projects.</description>
